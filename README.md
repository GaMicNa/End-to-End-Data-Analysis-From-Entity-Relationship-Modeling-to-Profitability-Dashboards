This project models the operations of a salteñas (***very delicius and bolivian traditional morning brunch***) factory using an Entity-Relationship Diagram, considering entities such as orders, branches, ingredients, employee shifts, and more. The goal is to analyze the data to propose improvements in operational efficiency and increase profit margins.
