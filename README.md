This report details the development and results of a data analysis project applied to a salteñas factory—a traditional Bolivian product similar to a meat-filled empanada. The factory distributes its salteñas to stores in the cities of Cochabamba, Oruro, Sacaba, Quillacollo, and Tiquipaya. With operations organized in early morning and morning shifts and a well-managed inventory system, the main objective of the project is to improve operational efficiency and increase profitability. To achieve this, a combination of data modeling, storage and querying in PostgreSQL, and data visualization with Tableau was utilized.
